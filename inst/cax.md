# Using CAX HLI data

## About the data

This data is provided to the CAX by agencies and tribes in order to increase collaboration opportunities and consistency in analyses. StreamNet and CAP host and help develop the Data Exchange Standards, but responsibility and rights are retained by the data providers. Data accessibility or versioning access requests should be directed to project@streamnet.org and questions about the datasets or appropriate use should be directed towards hli$ContactAgency hli$ContactPersonFirst hli$contactpersonlast hli$contactphone hli$contactemail No, I don't know that there's a spiffy way to present that, but is there a way to show those fields should be attached to each record?

## How data quality is indicated
How do I filter?
